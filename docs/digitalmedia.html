                    This audio project is from my Writing for the Public class taken during the 
                    Fall 2022 semester. I wrote this audio essay on political polarization using
                    my town as a case study. This piece highlights my small town's reaction to Jarrod Kuhn's participation
                    in the 2016 Unite the Right Rally. Read more about this case study

                    political polarization is and how it has increased in recent years in a more digestable form. Download the file or view it in a larger interface <a href="digital_media/infographic.png">here</a>.

                <p class ='item-p'> This is a soundscape I created this semester for my Composing Digital Media class. My goal was to use sound to recreate the experience 
                    of a person going to the gym, thus allowing the listener to feel as though they are living in
                    the storyline.

                <img alt='Infographic encouraging people to stop using cigarettes. Black background with person smoking. Cigarette with smoke forming
                Nike swoosh shape. White text reading DONT DO IT followed by text reading Cigarette smoking causes one in five deaths
                in the United States each year.' src='digital_media/visual_argument_portfolio.png'/>
                <p class='item-p'>This visual argument is also from my Composing Digital Media course. My project is titled 
                  “Don’t Do It” and is an anti-smoking campaign. It is a play on Nike’s iconic “Just Do It” campaigns. 
                  I wanted to mimic something very recognizable for this project without replicating it exactly. 
                  The simplicity of these campaigns is what inspired my design and I think it translated well to the final result. 
                  The straightforwardness of the design draws the viewer’s attention directly to the message, which is to not smoke. 
                  I am also very content with how the cigarette and smoke formed into a shape implying the Nike logo, a move that 
                  I feel points the viewer exactly in the direction of a Nike campaign.

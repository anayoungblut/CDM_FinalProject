                <h2 class='item-p'>University of Pittsburgh</h2>
                <p class='item-p'>This is the <a href='https://www.tour.pitt.edu/tour/cathedral-learning'>Cathedral of Learning</a>, colloquially known as "Cathy"
                  among Pitt students. It is the tallest academic building 
                  in the Western Hemisphere and houses classrooms, offices, libraries, 
                  digital and computer labs, and a small food court. This building is also 
                  unique because it houses several Nationality Classrooms throughout the first
                  three floors; these rooms were designed in the styles of various ethnic groups
                  in Pittsburgh. As a student of the Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences, I have had many of
                  my classes in Cathy throughout the years.

                <h2 class='item-p'>New York City</h2>
                <p class ='item-p'>This photo is from a visit to New York City over Winter Break this year. 
                  I absolutely adore NYC, but had not visited in the few years since my aunt and uncle moved upstate.
                  NYC is my measure of what a true city is, though I understand that this may not be the most 
                  appropriate measure given that fact that it is so unique in its culture and the density
                  to which it is inhabited. Perhaps this measure is why
                  Pittsurgh has always felt like a small, somewhat underpopulated city in my eyes. 
                  I took this picture near Rockefeller Center; photos facing upward that show the scale
                  of buildings are some of my favorite to capture. This perspective forces the viewer to
                  insert themself into the image as if they are standing on the street looking up skyscrapers.

                <p class ='item-p'>I am a player on the Pitt Women's Club Lacrosse team; this means that I 
                  have the opportunity to travel to places I've never been to before for tournaments. This past season,
                  we were invited to attend the 'Mile High' tournament hosted by the University of Colorado Boulder.
